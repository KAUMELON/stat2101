<p>Software is a set of programs, procedures, algorithms and associated
data, designed to perform a well-defined function.  A program is a
sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem. There
are two types of software viz. Application Software and System Software
(Platform Software)</p>
<div id="application-software" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Application Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#application-software"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>products are designed to satisfy a particular
need of a particular environment.  All software applications prepared in
the computer lab can come under the category of Application software. 
Application software may consist of a single program, such as
Microsoft's notepad for writing and editing a simple text.  It may also
consist of a collection of programs, often called a software package,
which work together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet
package.  Examples are MS Word, MS Excel. MS Access, MS PP, notepad,
payroll, mark sheet software, IT software, Aadhar Card software</p>
<p><em>Application Software </em>are generally written in High Level Language and
so are easier to understand.  They are comparatively easier to design,
are close to the user and are generally more interactive.  Manipulation,
editing and use of application software are easier when compared to
system software.  However, since they have to be translated into machine
language before being processed, they are slower.</p>
</div>
<div id="system-software" class="section level3" number="3.1.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> System Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#system-software"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is a collection of programs designed to operate,
control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. 
They are generally prepared by the computer manufacturers. These
software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages,
which interact with the hardware at a very basic level. System software
serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users.  Some
examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter
and Assemblers</p>
<p><em>System Software </em>are generally written in low-level language and so are
not easily understood by the user.  However, they are close to the
system and do not require any translation before being executed.  Hence
they have high speed.  They possesses less interactive abilities, are
small sized programs and are extremely difficult to design, manipulate
and edit. </p>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.1</span> System Software Types<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#system-software-types"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Systems software can be categorized under the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Harnesses communication between hardware,
system programs, and other applications (Windows, Unix, OSX)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device driver:</strong> Enables device communication with the OS and other
programs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Firmware:</strong> Enables device control and identification</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Translates high-level languages to low-level machine
codes (Compilers, Assemblers, Interpreters)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Utility:</strong> Ensures optimum functionality of devices and
applications e.g. anti-virus software, backup software and disk tools</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device Drivers</strong> These system software make it possible for all
connected components and external add-ons to perform their intended
tasks and as directed by the OS. Without drivers, the OS would not
assign any duties to the components. Examples of devices which require
drivers: are mouse, keyboard, soundcard, displaycard, network card and
printer. Usually, the operating system come with drivers for most
devices. By default, drivers for input devices such as the mouse and
keyboard will be installed. If a device is newer than the operating
system, the user may have to download drivers from manufacturer websites
or alternative sources.</p></li>

<p>These are system software that exist between system and
application software. They are diagnostic programs, perform maintenance
tasks for the computer and ensure that the computer performs optimally.
They focus on the operation of a computer and so are highly technical. 
Their tasks vary from crucial data security to disk drive
defragmentation. Most are third-party tools but may come bundled with
the operating system. Third-party tools are available individually or
bundled together such as with Hiren Boot CD, Ultimate Boot CD, and
Kaspersky Rescue Disk.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Firmware<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#firmware"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>It is the operational software embedded within a flash, ROM,
or EPROM memory chip for the OS to identify it. It directly manages and
controls all activities of any single hardware. Traditionally, firmware
used to mean fixed software as denoted by the word <em>firm</em>. It was
installed on non-volatile chips and could be upgraded only by swapping
them with new, pre-programmed chips.  This was done to differentiate
them from high-level software, which could be updated without having to
swap components. Today, firmware is stored in flash chips, which can be
upgraded without swapping semiconductor chips.</p>
<p>The most important firmware in computers today is installed by the
manufacturer on the motherboard and can be accessed through the old BIOS
(Basic Input/Output System) or the new UEFI (Unified Extended Firmware
Interface) platforms. It is the configuration interface which loads
first when the computer is powered up and is going through POST (Power
On Self Test). The user can change the BIOS and UEFI settings by
pressing special keys (a function key, delete, or the esc key) at
boot-up to load the configuration page</p>
<p>Though they work differently, firmware compliments drivers in a few
ways. Both give identity to hardware devices, with the latter making the
operating system see the device. The major difference between the two
is that firmware will always reside within devices while drivers will
install within the operating system</p>

<div id="assemblers" class="section level2" number="3.4">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Assemblers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assemblers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Assemblers are computer programs that translate programs written in
Assembly Language into machine language.  The translated program is
called an object program.  The Assembler checks the accuracy of each
instruction and generates diagnostic messages, if there are errors in
the program.  </p>
<p>Steps followed by Assemblers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Input source program in Assembly Language through an input device.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Assembler to produce object program in machine language.</p></li>
<li><p>Execute the program.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="compiler" class="section level2" number="3.5">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Compiler<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#compiler"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Compiler is a program that translates codes written in High Level
Languages (HLL), into executable machine language. This is a complex
process when compared to the translation using assemblers. The compiler
translates the entire source code into machine code before execution.
During translation, compilers provide error messages after appropriate
diagnosis of the HLL code. Each time the corrections have to be made and
recompiled until all errors are resolved.</p>
<p>Compilation involves</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Translation of the HLL source program to machine code</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing of variables in the program</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of subroutine links</p></li>
<li><p>Memory allocation for the variables and program<br>
Generation of error messages , if required</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="interpreter" class="section level2" number="3.6">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Interpreter<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpreter"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Interpreter is a program that translates codes written in HLL into
machine codes. Each line of code is diagnosed for errors and error
messages are given.  Once errors are corrected, the line is translated
into machine code, which is the executable version. This means that the
interpreter translates each instruction, executes it and only then the
next instruction is translated and this goes on until end of the
program. In this case, object code is not stored and reused. Each time
the program is executed, the interpreter translates each instruction
afresh. The disadvantage of an interpreter is that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instructions in the program must be translated each time they are
executed.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to this, interpretation is 20 times slower that compilation</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>Memory Management</strong>− Keeps track of the primary memory, i.e. what
part of it is in use by whom, what part is not in use, etc. and
allocates the memory when a process or program requests it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processor Management</strong>− Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process
and deallocates the processor when it is no longer required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device Management</strong>− Keeps track of all the devices. This is also
called I/O controller that decides which process gets the device, when,
and for how much time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File Management</strong>− Allocates and de-allocates the resources and
decides who gets the resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong>− Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by
means of passwords and other similar techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Job Accounting</strong>− Keeps track of time and resources used by
various jobs and/or users.</p></li>
